## 💡 Usage Tip — Discord + Mobile Control Panel
 
AutomationZ works especially well when combined with **Discord notifications** and your hosting provider’s **mobile control panel**. 

How admins actually use it in practice:

1. A Steam Workshop mod updates
2. AutomationZ detects the update and deploys it
3. A **Discord notification** confirms the upload is finished
4. You open your host’s control panel on your phone
   - e.g. **Nitrado App**, or any host web panel
5. Press **Restart Server**

That’s it.

This works:
- At work
- At home
- While traveling
- While fishing 🎣
- Or even jokingly… space travel with GPS internet 🚀😄

Even if you do nothing:
- Most servers restart every 2–4 hours anyway
- The next scheduled restart will load the updated mods

This turns worst‑case **24‑hour downtime** into **minutes or one restart cycle**, without full automation or loss of control.

AutomationZ keeps the **human in the loop**, while removing the boring waiting part.
